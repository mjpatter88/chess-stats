# chess-stats

This tool finds your "best" best win based on chess.com data.
Like beating Michael Jordan in a free-throw contest in 5th grade, this tool finds your most impressive sounding win.
It does this by looking at each opponent that you've beaten and then finding their highest rating across all time controls.
You may not have beaten a 2500 in bullet, but if the 1200 you beat was once 2500 in daily, isn't that close enough?


### Example output
```
Username: mjpatter88

Opponent with highest rating in any time control:
batallongorila
Rapid: 2330
Blitz: 2505
Bullet: 2219
